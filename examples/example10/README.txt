Using GLC_lib into QGraphicsScene and QGraphicsView
===========================================
This example is a GLC_lib adaption of "Accelerate your Widgets with OpenGL"
article in Qt Quarterly 26.

See http://doc.qt.digia.com/qq/qq26-openglcanvas.html
See http://www.glc-lib.net

The example is provided with a qmake project file which can be used to
configure and build the source code.

To build the source code, Qt 4.8.x and GLC_lib dev version
(https://github.com/laumaya/GLC_lib/zipball/master) are needed
